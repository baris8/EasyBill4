    easybill REST API

     The first version of the easybill REST API. [CHANGELOG](https://api.easybill.de/rest/v1/CHANGELOG.md)  ## Authentication  You can choose between two available methods: `Basic Auth` or `Bearer Token`.  In each HTTP request, one of the following HTTP headers is required:  ``` # Basic Auth Authorization: Basic base64_encode('<email>:<api_key>') # Bearer Token Authorization: Bearer <api_key> ```  ## Limitations  ### Request Limit  * PLUS: 10 requests per minute * BUSINESS: 60 requests per minute  If the limit is exceeded, you will receive the HTTP error: `429 Too Many Requests`  ### Result Limit  All result lists are limited to 100 by default. This limit can be increased by the query parameter `limit` to a maximum of 1000.  ## Query filter  Many list resources can be filtered. In `/documents` you can filter e.g. by number with `/documents?number=111028654`. If you want to filter multiple numbers, you can either enter them separated by commas `/documents?number=111028654,222006895` or as an array `/documents?number[]=111028654&number[]=222006895`.  **Warning**: The maximum size of an HTTP request line in bytes is 4094. If this limit is exceeded, you will receive the HTTP error: `414 Request-URI Too Large`  ### Escape commas in query  You can escape commans in query `name=Patrick\\, Peter` if you submit the header `X-Easybill-Escape: true` in your request.  ## Property login_id  This is the login of your admin or employee account.  ## Date and Date-Time format Please use the timezone `Europe/Berlin`. * **date** = *Y-m-d* = `2016-12-31` * **date-time** = *Y-m-d H:i:s* = `2016-12-31 03:13:37`  Date or datetime can be `null` because the attributes have been added later and the entry is older.  # noqa: E501
